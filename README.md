# Euro 2024 ML Predictor

Uses machine learning techniques that I recently learnt about in my ML classes to predict the outcomes of the UEFA Euro 2024 qualification matches. The predictions include rankings, wins, draws, and losses for teams in the competition.

Originally inspired by how bookies found predictions for sports betting. Plan to make a predictor that challenges the bookies in the future that focuses on match specifics rather than the final outcome.

## Dataset
